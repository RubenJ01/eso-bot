          "**Ice blast** – Watch for the spreading AoE effect that comes from underneath the boss! When this mechanic starts happening, get out of the area, it will hit really hard and apply a knock down. This mechanic is VERY important to get used to for the last boss.",
          "**Drain** – The boss will pick a random target to attach a draining effect beam and the longer he holds the target in the air the more health he will gain back, you MUST break free from this.",
          "**Blast** – The boss periodically channels a cast timed ability which will launch a blast in aoe of affect at a random target. This can be interrupted so pay close attention to this and it wont ever be a problem. However if it is cast, just move out of the way before it lands."

They have very low health and are easy to kill quickly."

Key points for this fight are to make sure you do not run around, all find your own space and preserve your stamina, you WILL need it. This boss can be debuffed but NOT taunted, so the tank should keep up debuffs and grab adds. The tank is “protect mode” for this fight."

If you are the target, shield/block if (magicka) or block/dodge roll if (stamina). The healer should focus the target and keep them up, as 2 of these light attacks in a row without a heal WILL kill you.",
          "**Teleport and ice blast** – She will periodically teleport and spawn at a different location. The second she lands she will emit a very large AoE from under her and once it is at peak it will burst with ice shards from the ground. IF this hits a dps/healer, they are dead. One shot! Avoid this at all costs and THEN get back into position.",
          "**Ice Wraiths** – At 50% and under she will spawn ice wraiths (x2) every so often, these have light attacks and can use a charge ability which will knock down players, these are easy to spot and should be avoided or blocked. Tank should taunt these and stick them on the boss. AoE damage alone should be able to dispatch these fast.",
          "**Ice Atronachs** – Under 25% she will spawn 2x frost atronachs. They spawn spikes from the ground which should be avoided and they also attack with frontal cone attacks. The tank should treat these just like the wraiths and stack them on the boss so they can be killed with AoE. If they are on you and you are a dps/healer, just block. Let the tank grab control of them.",
          "**Drain!**– Periodically she will attach a beam to the target and every second will drain their health and heal herself. She heals by a lot. The KEY point to this mechanic is you MUST “BREAK FREE!”. If you do not have enough stamina to do so you are in trouble! When the beam is on you, break free instantly! This is why you must preserve your stamina throughout the fight."
